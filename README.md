# JianDan Short-Drama Skill

Official Agent Skill for the JianDan AI marketing short-drama platform. It teaches Codex, OpenClaw, TRAE, and other compatible agents how to operate short-drama projects safely through the `jd-drama` CLI.

[中文说明](./README.zh-CN.md)

## Status

- Skill version: `1.0.0-beta.9`
- Required CLI: `@flyengine/jd-drama-cli@1.0.0-beta.9` or later
- Matching MCP: `@flyengine/jd-drama-mcp@0.1.0-beta.6` (optional)
- Service: [jiandan.flyengine.cn](https://jiandan.flyengine.cn/)
- Stage: public beta

The public beta connects to production user data and real quotas. All write operations must be previewed with `--dry-run` and explicitly approved with `--confirm`.

## Capabilities

- Discover and inspect short-drama projects, brands, and material libraries.
- Create projects from an AI idea or an uploaded script.
- Read, replace, verify, version, and restore official script episodes.
- Extract and parse assets through the system for uploaded, AI-generated, and secondary-created scripts; edit and regenerate existing parsed assets.
- Generate, inspect, optimize, and update storyboard segments, including Seedance 2.5 configuration.
- Generate and inspect video tasks; attach a local video to a storyboard segment.
- Diagnose failed tasks and produce recovery plans.

## Install

Install the CLI first:

```bash
npm install -g @flyengine/jd-drama-cli@beta
jd-drama --version
```

Install the bundled skill for your agent:

```bash
# Codex
jd-drama --json skill install --target codex --scope user --dry-run
jd-drama --json skill install --target codex --scope user --confirm

# OpenClaw
jd-drama --json skill install --target openclaw --scope user --dry-run
jd-drama --json skill install --target openclaw --scope user --confirm

# TRAE, run in the target project
jd-drama --json skill install --target trae --scope project --project-dir . --dry-run
jd-drama --json skill install --target trae --scope project --project-dir . --confirm

# WorkBuddy, run in the target project and follow the returned harness sync steps
jd-drama --json skill doctor --target workbuddy
```

The same `SKILL.md` can also be installed directly from this repository using the target agent's GitHub skill installation workflow.

## Authorize

```bash
jd-drama auth login
jd-drama --json release-check
```

Authorization happens in the JianDan website. Never provide a JianDan password or manually copied token to an agent.

Connectors that cannot keep a login process running can use non-blocking authorization with the required CLI:

```bash
jd-drama auth login --no-wait --no-open
# After browser approval:
jd-drama --json auth status
jd-drama --json release-check
```

The CLI saves the pending request before showing the verification URL. Status, doctor, and release checks can finish that request after browser approval. While `pendingAuthorization` is true, wait for `retryAfterSeconds` instead of starting another login. Pending requests and saved credentials are isolated by config path and API environment, and concurrent status calls share the credential lock. MCP `0.1.0-beta.6` starts this non-blocking flow automatically through `jd_drama_auth_login`; call `jd_drama_status` after browser approval.

Local agents normally share one browser authorization. Check `jd-drama --json doctor` and authorize only when `auth.browserAuthorization.needsLogin` is true. Do not log out and log in as an automatic repair: logout revokes the shared session for all tools. Resolve filesystem, Keychain, or network diagnostics before retrying. Missing brand/material scopes require one new browser approval, without a preceding logout.

## Quick Start

```bash
jd-drama --json projects list --limit 10
jd-drama --json brands list --limit 10
jd-drama --json materials folders
jd-drama --json ai-script options
jd-drama --json tasks recovery-plan PROJECT_ID
```

Preview project creation without writing data:

```bash
jd-drama --json ai-script create \
  --idea "A fast-paced urban product marketing short drama" \
  --episode-count 1 \
  --name "Agent beta test" \
  --aspect-ratio-code portrait_9_16 \
  --generate \
  --dry-run
```

### Project Aspect Ratio

Use `--aspect-ratio-code` in CLI commands, or `aspectRatioCode` in MCP parameters:

- Vertical 9:16: `portrait_9_16`.
- Horizontal 16:9: `landscape_16_9`.
- Other formats: select an enabled `aspectRatio[].code` returned by `ai-script start-parse` or `imports start-parse`; do not invent codes or use `ratioLabel`.

CLI `1.0.0-beta.9` also normalizes the known labels `9:16` and `16:9` to these codes. Explicit codes are preferred and work with older clients. Inspect the final create-project body in the dry-run; a local preview does not verify server-side availability.

## Safety

- Use `--json` for agent calls.
- Run the exact command with `--dry-run` before replacing it with `--confirm`.
- Do not bypass CLI safety boundaries through raw API calls.
- Do not expose passwords, authorization codes, local configuration files, or tokens.
- Do not test destructive commands against valuable production projects.
- Brand association is available only during initial project creation.
- Asset records must be created by system extraction and parsing, never manually or through direct API calls. Wait for extraction to succeed before deep parsing, and for parsing to succeed before image generation. Deep parsing may consume credits.
- Upgrade every local CLI/MCP client. The matching backend update blocks manual creation from older clients only after that backend is deployed.
